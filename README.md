sudoku
======

This my final project for [CS3102](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/cs3102/), theory of computation.

The program will solve and size sudoku puzzle using a combination of constraint propogation and backtracking search. I have capped the inner square size to 5, however, as the board becomes too large to fit on most monitors beyond this dimension.

The only "extraneous" dependency is the FLTK toolkit used to build the GUI. More information can be found [here](http://www.fltk.org/index.php). 

Everything should build with make. Tested on OSX.
