sudoku
======

This my final project for CS3102, theory of computation.

The program will theoretically solve and size sudoku puzzle, however, I have capped the inner square size to 5 (at this point most monitors are not large enough to display the board).

As long as the FLTK package is installed (used for GUI, everything *should* build with make on most platforms. Tested on OSX.
