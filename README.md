sudoku
======

This is the final project for CS3102, theory of computation.

The program will theoretically solve and size sudoku puzzle, however, I have capped the inner square size to 5 (at this point most monitors are not large enough to display the board).

The only dependency is the the FLTK toolkit. As long as this package is installed, everything *should* build with make on any platform. (Tested on OSX)
